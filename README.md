# A self-navigatng robot for search and rescue(incomplete)
This project is my final year capstone project - A self-navigating robot for search and rescue. We build a robot in ROS and integrate several functions: self-navigation, object detection and tracking, and an Arduino board to grab simple objects. The final demostration video is shown here: https://youtu.be/2dpzOpEn4hM

## Overview of the project
We did not build everthing from ground. We bought a SLAM robot from Taobao https://m.tb.cn/h.VIjRDe7?sm=fc07a3 and then add on other functions.
