# A self-navigatng robot for search and rescue(incomplete)
This project is my final year capstone project - A self-navigating robot for search and rescue. We build a robot in ROS and integrate several functions: self-navigation, object detection and tracking, and an Arduino board to grab simple objects. The final demostration video is shown here: https://youtu.be/2dpzOpEn4hM

## Overview of the projec
We bought a SLAM robot from Taobao https://m.tb.cn/h.VIjRDe7?sm=fc07a3 and then add on other functions. Most of the packages are either provided by the seller or opensource. Our contribution is mainly integrate them to perform a much simplified 'rescue mission'. To achieve that we first use gampping for mapping and move_base for navigation. The object detection is based on color using opencv and object trakcing is more original where we devide the screen to different parts and correspnds to a certain /cmd_vel. The robot is constrcuted
